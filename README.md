# Retinal Disease Detection and Classification

# By: Jalen Wu, Yechan Na, Jonathan Zhang

__Project Description:__

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting retinal diseases by analyzing fundus images of the eye. Using computer vision and deep learning techniques, the model assists in early detection and diagnosis of retinal disease(s).

__Applications and Impact:__

This project could be used for clinical screening to help ophthalmologists identify diseases and improve efficiency on identifying these diseases. This automated detection system has the potential to make medical imaging diagnostics more accessible.

__What we hope to achieve:__

We hope to build a model that takes in images of the eye and accurately predicts whether an individualâ€™s eyes are healthy or showing signs of disease. To quantify the effectiveness of our model, we will be measuring metrics such as F1 score, precision, recall, loss, and accuracy of our models and graphing them as a function of how many epochs we run on our training data (all of these scores should increase in subsequent epochs).
